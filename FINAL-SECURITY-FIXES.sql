-- =====================================================
-- FINAL SECURITY FIXES - REMAINING ISSUES
-- =====================================================
-- Fixes the last 2 ERROR-level security issues

-- 1. FIX SECURITY DEFINER VIEWS (CRITICAL - ERROR LEVEL)
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the problematic views that have SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_progress CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS admin_stats CASCADE;

-- Recreate user_progress view WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
CREATE VIEW user_progress AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.student_id,
    u.name,
    u.email,
    d.name as domain_name,
    d.code as domain_code,
    COUNT(s.id) as completed_tasks,
    AVG(s.final_score)::INTEGER as avg_score,
    u.created_at
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN domains d ON u.domain_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN submissions s ON u.id = s.user_id AND s.status = 'completed'
WHERE u.role = 'S'
GROUP BY u.id, u.student_id, u.name, u.email, d.name, d.code, u.created_at;

-- Recreate admin_stats view WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
CREATE VIEW admin_stats AS
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'S') AS students,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM submissions WHERE status = 'completed') AS submissions,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificates WHERE is_revoked = false) AS certificates,
    (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0)::DECIMAL(12,2) FROM payments WHERE status = 'completed') AS revenue;

-- Add RLS policies for the views (if needed)
-- Views inherit RLS from underlying tables, so this should be sufficient

-- 2. VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- =====================================================

-- Check that views no longer have SECURITY DEFINER
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND viewname IN ('user_progress', 'admin_stats');

-- Test that views work correctly
SELECT 'Testing user_progress view:' as test;
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM user_progress;

SELECT 'Testing admin_stats view:' as test;
SELECT * FROM admin_stats;

-- 3. SUCCESS CONFIRMATION
-- =====================================================
SELECT '‚úÖ SECURITY DEFINER VIEWS FIXED - ERROR LEVEL ISSUES RESOLVED' as status;

-- =====================================================
-- OPTIONAL: AUTH CONFIGURATION IMPROVEMENTS (WARNING LEVEL)
-- =====================================================
-- These are WARNING level and should be configured in Supabase Dashboard, not SQL

/*
MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD:

1. AUTH OTP EXPIRY (WARNING):
   - Go to Authentication > Settings
   - Set "Email OTP expiry" to 3600 seconds (1 hour) or less
   - Currently it's set to more than 1 hour

2. LEAKED PASSWORD PROTECTION (WARNING):
   - Go to Authentication > Settings  
   - Enable "Leaked password protection"
   - This checks passwords against HaveIBeenPwned database

These cannot be fixed via SQL - they require dashboard configuration.

-- FINAL SECURITY AUDIT
-- =====================================================

-- Check all tables have RLS enabled
SELECT

    schemaname,
    tablename,
    CASE 
        WHEN rowsecurity THEN '‚úÖ Enabled'
        ELSE '‚ùå DISABLED'
    END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check all policies exist
SELECT 
    'Policy Check:' as audit_type,
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY schemaname, tablename
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check views are secure
SELECT 
    'View Security Check:' as audit_type,
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    CASE 
        WHEN definition LIKE '%SECURITY DEFINER%' THEN '‚ùå SECURITY DEFINER FOUND'
        ELSE '‚úÖ Safe'
    END as security_status
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'

-- Final status
