Looking at the recurring authentication issues, I'll suggest a much simpler and more reliable approach that eliminates all the complexity and follows modern best practices.

🎯 Recommended Approach: Simplified Authentication Flow
Core Philosophy: Keep It Simple
Instead of trying to handle both mock and real authentication with complex state management, let's create a single, unified flow that's bulletproof.

📋 Suggested New Flow
1. Single Authentication Method
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Landing Page  │ -> │  Apply/Register  │ -> │  Login & Use    │
│   (Marketing)   │    │   (One-time)     │    │   (Recurring)   │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
2. Unified User Journey
New Users: Visit /apply → Fill application → Get credentials → Login
Existing Users: Direct to /login → Enter credentials → Dashboard
No Separate Signup: Application = Registration
3. Simple State Management
// Single source of truth
const authState = {
  user: User | null,
  loading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}

🚀 My Recommendation: Start Fresh with Ultra-Simple Auth
Based on the recurring issues, I suggest we completely restart with this approach:

1. Delete Complex Auth Files
Remove the current auth system
Start with a clean slate
No more dual authentication complexity
2. Implement Single-Flow Authentication
// One simple auth service
class SimpleAuth {
  login(email: string, password: string): User | null
  logout(): void
  getCurrentUser(): User | null
}
3. Unified User Experience
New Users: Apply → Get credentials → Login
Existing Users: Login directly
No separate signup page
4. Rock-Solid State Management
// Simple context provider
const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout, loading }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  )
}
🎯 Why This Will Work
No Hydration Issues: Pure client-side auth state
No Cookie Conflicts: Simple token-based auth
Clear User Journey: Apply → Login → Use
Easy to Debug: Single auth flow
Production Ready: Same interface, different backend
🤔 Should We Implement This?
This approach will:

✅ Eliminate all current authentication errors
✅ Provide a clear, simple user experience
✅ Be much easier to maintain and debug
✅ Scale to production seamlessly
Would you like me to implement this simplified approach? It will take about 30 minutes to build and will be much more reliable than the current complex system.

The key insight is: Complexity is the enemy of reliability. Let's build something simple that works perfectly rather than something complex that breaks.
